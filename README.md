## Problem

Global disparities in Expected Years of Schooling impact a country's overall development. Understanding the influence of education on economic development is crucial for targeting social inequalities.

## Objective

Analyze the connections between Expected Years of Schooling, Human Development Index (HDI) Rank and GDP.


## Key Insights

**_What are the disparities in Education across the world?_**

Significant variations of Years of Schooling from high levels in Australia to low in Niger and Chad.

**_How do Years of Schooling and GDP vary across continents?_**

Economic prosperity, represented by GDP,does not always align with the Educational Development.

**_What is the relationship between Human Development and Expected Years of Schooling?_**

A strong negative correlation (-0.7948) shows that higher Human Development is associated with decreased Expected Years of Schooling.

- Cluster 3 suggests diverse regions with low human development. 
- Clusters 1 and 2 demonstrate positive correlations between higher HDI ranks and increased schooling. 
- Cluster 4, uniquely, exhibits very high development but a low HDI rank.

## Results

- A consistent rise in average global Expected Years of Schooling from 10 years in 1990  to 13 years in 2021 indicates overall progress. 
- Significant variations in Expected Years of Schooling exist globally, from high levels in Australia to low values in Africa. 
- Higher Human Development is associated with decreased Expected Years of Schooling.
- A nuanced link between GDP and Expected Years of Schooling shows the complexity of factors affecting educational development.

## Recommendations

- Implement targeted education interventions in low Expected Years of Schooling countries like Niger and Chad. 
- Develop strategies for the complex Human Development and Expected Years of Schooling relationship. 
- Increase education in high Human Development regions, acknowledging the negative correlation. 
- Continue researching the evolving relationship between education, economic development and overall human development.
